# eslint--config-masterasp

This module contains globally acclaimed rules and standards that enforce
better code quality, diminish errors and prevent bugs.

It takes inspiration from:

 - [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://javascript.crockford.com/)
 - [goodparts](https://github.com/dwyl/goodparts)
 - [Eric Elliot](https://medium.com/@_ericelliott/latest)
 - My own personal bias (yes, we all have one, you can stop pretending)

This module is ready to work with the following environments out of the box:

 - ECMA6
 - node
 - mocha

And it contains the following rules:

 - no-useless-concat
 - prefer-template
 - no-template-curly-in-string
 - no-extra-parens
 - strict
 - no-iterator
 - no-with
 - no-trailing-spaces
 - eqeqeq
 - indent: 4,
 - linebreak-style
 - quotes: "double"
 - semi
 - no-console
 - no-var
 - prefer-const

Works for eslint versions >= 3.
